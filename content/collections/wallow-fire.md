  A personal project based on Arizona’s largest wildfire in history. This body
  of work explores the paradox of otherworldly beauty caused by a destructive
  man-made disaster. *The Wallow Fire* is dedicated to the families of the 19
  fallen firefighters of the Granite Mountain Hotshot Crew of Arizona who lost
  their lives in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30, 2013- the deadliest day for
  United States firefighters since September 11, 2001.


  Named as one of the top 50 international fine art photographic projects by
  *Photolucida’s Critical Mass.* Exhibited at Corden Potts Gallery San
  Francisco, Houston Center for Photography, and The Forty Eighth: Contemporary
  Photography at Arizona’s Centennial.

  In Eastern Arizona, near the border with New Mexico, is a land of dirt roads
  stretching out to white-washed horizons. Here, ranches are carved out of the
  scrub and pine-dotted landscapes and grazing cattle are the only living things
  for miles.


  The area’s beauty comes from its pervasive remoteness.


  But from late May to early June in 2011, the land in and surrounding the Bear
  Wallow Wilderness Area in the White Mountains was remade with a terrible,
  devastating kind of beauty. One that turned the landscape lunar and the air
  yellowed and hazy. A campfire sparked a conflagration that charred 841 miles
  across Arizona and New Mexico, destroying 72 buildings, 32 of them homes.


  As I traveled across the western United States in late May 2011, I saw the
  Wallow Fire, as it was named, and I was mesmerized by the towering smoke
  plumes and expanses of blackened earth. I stopped to stay, to photograph the
  fire, its effects, and the international community of men and women assembled
  to fight and eventually extinguish the blaze.


  I was drawn by the way the Wallow Fire, reshaped the landscape and the
  atmosphere, making it a surreal, deadly place where playgrounds stood empty,
  where tree bark turned to ash scales, where grazing land was charred to
  cinder, where the air swirled thick with smoke and heat. It quickly became the
  largest fire in Arizona’s history, forcing everyone to evacuate.


  Sadly, due to man made climate change, this was the first of many historic
  fires that has severely impacted the land and residents of Colorado,
  California, New Mexico, Texas, and again Arizona. This project is dedicated to
  the families of the 19 fallen firefighters of the Granite Mountain Hotshot
  Crew of Arizona who lost their lives in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30,
  2013. The deadliest day for United States firefighters since September 11,
  2001.
