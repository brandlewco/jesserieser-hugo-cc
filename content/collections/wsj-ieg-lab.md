  Inventor Dennis Danzik (first frame left) claims to have invented a self
  propelled generator which if checks out, would shatter our current
  understanding of physics. Danzik gave us a sneak peak of the “Earth Engine
  Generator” and the IEC lab in which it was created.


  The astrophysicist Carl Sagan liked to say that extraordinary claims require
  extraordinary evidence. But Danzik’s assertions blow past extraordinary and
  motor right on to fantastic.


  Mr. Danzik, the science and technology officer for Wyoming-based Inductance
  Energy Corp., says he has invented a magnetic generator, a flywheel system
  that extracts usable energy from the interplay of exotic magnets—also known as
  a free-energy device, a cousin to the fabled perpetual-motion machine.⁠


  Danzik winces at the phrase “perpetual motion,” with centuries of humbug
  behind it. “It’s a generator,” he said during an interview at IEC’s lab and
  training facility in Scottsdale, Ariz. Left running, the machines, known as
  Earth Engines, will eventually exhaust themselves. He just isn’t sure when.⁠


  IEC hired him in 2015 to improve design on a diesel generator for oil fields.
  When that project didn’t pan out, company Chief Executive Bill Hinz asked what
  other ideas he had.⁠


  “What if I showed you a device that you could put in the back of a pickup and
  power a city block?” Mr. Hinz said by phone, quoting what Mr. Danzik told him
  back then. Mr. Hinz—a former president and CEO of AlliedSignal
  Aerospace—uttered the appropriate epithet of incredulity. But after several
  more demonstrations, he became the Earth Engine’s second believer.⁠
