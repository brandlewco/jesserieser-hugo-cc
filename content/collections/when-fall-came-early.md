  This is a study of how climate change is altering the landscape and the
  backdrop to my childhood, my beloved Ozark Mountains. The most severe drought
  since the dust bowl caused leaves to turn color and drop in mid-July,
  shriveled corn never to be harvested, and left cattle unable to find food,
  shade or relief from hot, dusty winds. Published with *MSNBC* on the eve of
  the 2014 People’s Climate March.


  Winner of the 2015 *PDN Photography Annual* and *AP 30*: *American Photography
  2015.*

  Recently the United States experienced its worst drought in more than 50
  years. Roughly half the nation, most of the high plains, Midwest and South
  were in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. These
  photographs bear witness to how that drought devastated the Arkansas River
  Basin.


  “This is a study of how climate change is altering the landscape, the backdrop
  to my childhood, my beloved Ozark Mountains,” Jesse said.


  The drought caused leaves to turn color and drop in mid-July, shriveled corn
  never to be harvested, and left cattle unable to find food, shade or relief
  from hot, dusty winds.


  This collection of seven images is poignant, the images simple and stark in
  their quiet brutality. The photos are a prescient expression of the fear and
  anger 400,000 people gave voice to in September 2014 during the People’s
  Climate March in New York City, days before the United Nations climate summit.
