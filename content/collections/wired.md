  I photographed Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin as they await trial for owning and
  operating the online classified giant [Backpage.com](http://Backpage.com).
  Backpage was the red-light district of the internet or the Google of
  commercial sex ads. Described as “a platform that dominated its market as
  thoroughly as Facebook dominated social networking or Amazon did online
  retail.”


  Both men face life in prison and if found guilty, this sets a scary legal
  precedent for Silicon Valley. Lawmakers would have finally torn a hole in
  Section 230 of the Communications Act, holding tech giants such as Twitter and
  Facebook accountable, no longer immunized from user generated content.


  Selected by the 2020 American Photography Annual (AP 36) as one of the year's
  best in editorial photography.

  For the July / August issue of the ***Wired*** cover story “*The Internet
  Giant Who Went Too Far*” I photographed Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin as they
  await trial for owning and operating the online classified giant
  [Backpage.com](http://Backpage.com). Backpage was the red-light district of
  the internet or the Google of commercial sex ads and described as “a platform
  that dominated its market as thoroughly as Facebook dominated social
  networking or Amazon did online retail” and for this both men face life in
  prison.


  Larkin and Lacey founded *The Phoenix New Times* (my first ever assignment)
  and bought *The Village Voice* as they built the country’s largest chain of
  alt weeklies. They were known for their crusade-like journalism as they went
  after the McCains, Walmart, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, The Church of Scientology, and
  The NFL. And for this they made many enemies, enemies who are seeking
  retribution for the 30+ years of Larkin and Lacey relentlessly investigated
  those in power. “As a journalist, if you don’t get up in the morning and say
  ‘Fuck you’ to someone, why even do it?” - Lacey⁠


  If found guilty, this sets a scary legal precedent for silicon valley and any
  online platform. Lawmakers would have finally torn a hole in *Section 230* of
  the Communications Act and could hold tech giants such as Twitter and Facebook
  accountable as they would no longer be immunized from user generated content.


  As Both men await trial, they are under country arrest and cannot travel.
  Photographically I wanted to portray Lacey and Larkin in a way that spoke to
  their decades of defiance, possible incarceration, the shadowy space in which
  back page operated, and their physical and psychological imprisonment as they
  are confined to their homes and Maricopa County.
