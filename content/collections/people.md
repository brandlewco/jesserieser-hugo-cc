  Their 11-year-old 4th Grader was one of 21 victims killed at Robb Elementary
  School last May. The Salazar family are still feeling pain so raw it’s hard to
  move on.”


  I recently traveled to Uvalde, TX to spend the day with the Salazar family. I
  can’t thank them enough for their hospitality and openness while navigating
  and living every parent’s worst nightmare.&nbsp;


  “Layla was just 7 months old in 2011 when Vinnie, who worked for a steel
  company, moved the family from a Chicago suburb to his hometown of Uvalde
  because he believed it would be safer there.&nbsp;


  At around 11:40 a.m., May 22, 2022 Vinnie received a text message about a
  lockdown at the school. Then, a short while later, another text: An active
  shooter was on the school campus. Vinnie heard sirens wailing and cars racing
  past the family’s home and called Melinda at work to tell her the news. “By
  the time I got to the school, it was already chaos,” he says. “People were
  screaming and running everywhere.”


  Officials announced that no students or teachers had been hurt, Vinnie says,
  and they directed parents to pick up their children at the nearby civic
  center. There, over the course of the next hours, school buses packed with
  children arrived—but Layla never appeared. At 9 o’clock that evening, when the
  small group of parents remaining were asked to give DNA samples, Vinnie and
  Melinda realized they would never see Layla again. Not long afterward they
  were led into another room and informed that their DNA was a match for one of
  the victims. “ ‘We’re sorry,’ they told us,” Vinnie recalls as tears stream
  down his cheeks. “ ‘Your daughter was one of the deceased.’ ”


  At the end of their new hallway is an empty bedroom that echoes in silence,
  with neatly stacked clothes, a twin bed and a door plastered with Billie
  Eilish stickers leaning against a wall. That door was brought here from the
  family’s old house (last frame).
