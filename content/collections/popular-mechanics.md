  Pictured is 72 year old James Strohle. Strohle is cofounder of People
  Unlimited, a community to inspire people to live infinite lifespans, in 1995,
  then added the nonprofit Coalition for Radical Life Extension (CRLE) in 2016.
  A major goal of both organizations is to introduce the public to anti-aging
  developments so that when innovations come, they can be integrated into
  society as naturally as possible.⁠⁠<br>⁠⁠<br>He’s bullish on senolytics, drugs
  that purge the body of deteriorating cells, and exosome treatments, which
  infuse the body with little packages of extracellular communication materials,
  usually from immortal stem cells. Neither is approved by the U.S. Food and
  Drug Administration, but Strole says he feels like a teenager, living and
  working in the retirement paradise of Scottsdale, Arizona.⁠⁠


  What happens if Strohle doesn’t make it? If his doctor says he’s got six
  weeks? “First I’d do everything to turn that around, but I would look then at
  staying alive on some level. I probably would look at Cryogenic freezing."⁠⁠
