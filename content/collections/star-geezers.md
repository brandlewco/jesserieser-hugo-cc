  This is a story about “Sky Village,” an astronomy centric retirement community
  and their founders Jack and Alice Newton, also known as the “Star Geezers.”
  Sky Village is one of the most remote and darkest places in North America. So
  dark you never knew so many stars existed- appearing dizzying, textural, and
  3-dimensional.

  This is a story about “Sky Village,” an astronomy centric retirement community
  and their founders, the self appointed “Star Geezers,” Jack and Alice Newton.
  Located in Arizona near the New Mexico and Mexico border, the remoteness
  (closest grocery store is 3 hours away) is a gift as this is one of the
  darkest places on the North American light pollution map. Couple this with the
  clear air of the desert, this was how the Newtons selected and purchased
  several hundred acres of land and divided them into 22 distinct lots.


  Easily one of the most interesting places I have visited in recent memory. A
  close-knit community bonded by their love of the celestial, the remoteness,
  and the darkness….. so dark that on a new moon you can no longer see your
  feet. So dark you never knew so many stars existed- appearing dizzying,
  textural, and 3-dimensional. So dark as your eyes adjust, you can see your
  shadow cast by the stars overhead.
