  For the latest issue of *Outside Magazine*, I photographed travel, nature,
  conservation, and science writer David Quammen.


  “Golf is a concept, like death, seldom contemplated by the young” DQ opens
  with. Here Quammen touches on the beauty and merit of the game, the obvious
  irony of an environmentalist taking to the links, the history of golf courses
  in the landscape, and the lengths that contemporary courses are taking to be

  For the latest issue of _Outside Magazine_, I photographed travel, nature,
  conservation, and science writer David Quammen. Quammen’s 200+ editorial works
  have appeared in _National Geographic_, _Harper’s_, _The Atlantic_, _Rolling
  Stone_, _The New York Times_, and for 15 years penned a monthly column
  “Natural Acts” for _Outside Magazine_. We met up last fall for a round of golf
  while he was researching for his 16 book.


  “Golf is a concept, like death, seldom contemplated by the young” DQ opens
  with. Here Quammen touches on the beauty and merit of the game, the obvious
  irony of an environmentalist taking to the links, the history of golf courses
  in the landscape, and the lengths that contemporary courses are taking to be
  environmentally mindful.


  On the course we talked about game 7 of the 2019 World Series, our shared love
  for golf, Bozeman winters, mutual friends at _National Geographic_, both
  growing up in the Midwest, and my anxieties of what I may see in my lifetime
  due to climate change. A version of those anxieties are on display today as we
  navigate a new world and reality. Quammen also specializes in research on
  animal to human disease transmission and the author of _Spillover: Animal
  Infections and the Next Human Pandemic_, _Ebola: The Natural and Human History
  of a Deadly Virus_, and is currently offering his insights on COVID-19 to
  _NPR_, _Orion_, _The New York Times_, _The Hill_, and _Scientific American_.
