  “Disemboweled by an ATV, head butted by a horse: The painful stories behind
  Donald Cerrone’s injuries."


  A portfolio of intimate portraits paired with studies of Cowboy’s injuries
  appearing larger than life as abstractions of an anatomical landscape.
  Cowboy’s 18-month-old son Danger’s embrace with his father nicely bridges the
  gap between the landscape-like injuries and portraits, leaving the viewer with
  a sense of intimate masculinity.

  “Disemboweled by an ATV, head butted by a horse: The painful stories behind
  Donald Cerrone’s injuries."


  Ahead of UFC 246 welterweight bout at the T Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, I
  headed out to Edgewood, NM to visit with Donald “Cowboy” Ceronne at his BMF
  (Bad Mother Fucker) ranch + gym.


  As he faced off against the sport’s most popular and recognizable personality
  in Conor McGregor, Cerrone is a fighter’s fighter, holding the sports all time
  record of wins, bouts, and fights finished. He appeared calm, gracious, funny,
  and at peace with this stage of his career and the “biggest fight of his
  life.”


  Conceptually my goal was to create a portfolio of intimate portraits paired
  with studies of Cowboy’s injuries- tightly framed and appearing larger than
  life as abstractions of an anatomical landscape. It was an unexpected bonus
  that his 18 month old son “Danger” wanted to be a part of the project. His
  involvement and embrace with his father nicely bridges the gap between the
  landscape-like injury studies and portraits, leaving the viewer with a sense
  of intimate masculinity.
