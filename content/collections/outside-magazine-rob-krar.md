collection_description: >-
  Rob Krar had to embrace incredible physical pain to win iconic ultramarathons
  like the Leadville Traill 100 and the Western States Endurance Run. But that’s
  a form suffering he can control- unlike his decades-long struggle with
  depression.⁠ Krar opens up about his battle with depression, the balance of
  his personal life and life as a professional athlete, what he means to the
  running community, and how his running camp has “saved lives.”

  “*Rob Krar had to embrace incredible physical pain to win iconic
  ultramarathons like the Leadville Traill 100 and the Western States Endurance
  Run. But that’s a form suffering he can control- unlike his decades-long
  struggle with depression.*”⁠


  This past fall my brother Shea and I visited the 5th annual *Rob Krar Running
  Camp* in Flagstaff, AZ. It was the perfect time of year- the air cool and
  crisp as fall approached and the aspens golden in color illuminated Locket
  Meadow. As someone who copes with clinical depression and anxiety disorder, we
  loved our time with Rob, Christina, campers, and volunteers.


  Article by former *Runner’s World* editor Christine Fennessy, Krar opens up
  about his battle with depression, the balance of his personal life and life a
  professional athlete, what he means to the running community, and how his
  running camp has “saved lives."
