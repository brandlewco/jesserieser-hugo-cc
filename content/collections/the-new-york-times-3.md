  While big leaguers fight with owners about labor issues, minor leaguers like
  Jack Kruger are getting ready for another season of long bus rides and longer
  odds.


  “Get on the first plane to Los Angeles,” his manager said.


  The Angels, Salt Lake’s parent club, were promoting Kruger to the majors to
  replace a catcher with a concussion. The Angels were playing the Tampa Bay
  Rays that evening, May 6, 2021, and he was expected to be there.


  He watched from the bench as the game spun by quickly. Fifth inning. Sixth.
  Seventh. Finally, in the ninth inning, Kruger got the nod. He jogged to the
  plate, eyes focused, shin guards, chest protector and catcher’s mask on.


  There had been no time to warm up properly. He had taken only six practice
  throws instead of his usual 40. What if he had to make a quick throw to second
  base? Would the ball sail into the outfield? Would it hit the pitcher. But
  everything unfolded perfectly. The Angels got three quick outs. Final score:
  Tampa Bay 8, Los Angeles 3. Kruger’s team lost, and he never got to bat, but
  at least he tasted the big time.


  Here’s the thing about professional baseball: It does not take long for harsh
  reality to crash down.


  The next day, as Kruger readied for his second game with the Angels, a team
  executive pulled him aside. Kruger thought he was about to get a hearty
  congratulations. Instead, the executive informed him that he was being
  designated for assignment — a kind of baseball purgatory. If no other team
  wanted him, the Angels could send him back to the minors or cut him
  completely.


  Kruger has always been an underdog. As a child he developed Perthes disease, a
  hip bone disorder that forced him to use crutches for nearly two years in
  grade school. Because the disorder slowed his growth, he was often the
  smallest player on the field until midway through high school.


  “Jack has what I call a ‘figure-it-out component,’” said his college coach.
  “He’s the guy who can figure out how to get off the island. He could be on
  Wall Street right now, he could be in business right now, he could be a lawyer
  now. But he loves baseball too much.”


  I see myself on the Rangers, behind the dish, helping lead the team to a win
  in the World Series,” he said. “You have to be delusional in a way. Confident
  where you 110 percent believe that you are the right man for the job. And if
  other people don’t see it, then they’re wrong, and you have to show them
  that.”
