title: The Class of 99
collection_meta: Turns 30
collection_meta_2: 2009 - 2010
collection_description: >-
  Captured while visiting my hometown for my 10-year high school reunion, this
  personal work investigates what has been gained or lost while entering
  adulthood during the great recession. Like all generations, we struggle to
  define ourselves as parents, citizens, family members and spouses. We work to
  create meaningful lives; we work to understand what “meaningful” looks like.


  Winner of the *American Photography Annual: AP 26.*

  In 2010, my high school classmates and I turned 30. As we entered adulthood we
  had reason to be optimistic and confident. Our formative years were cocooned
  in security, a youth spent in a time of economic growth and low unemployment.


  This is what we were promised: “*You are being bequeathed the tools for
  achieving a material existence that neither my generation or any that preceded
  it could have even remotely imagined as we began our life’s work.*” – Allan
  Greenspan 1999 commencement speech.


  But when I made these photographs, unemployment hovered at 9.6 percent.
  Housing foreclosures were at an all-time high and personal bankruptcy filings
  affected 1.7 million Americans. My generation is the first in 100 years
  unlikely to be financially better off than its parents. It’s in this moment of
  transition that I photographed my classmates in settings relevant to the lives
  they are building.


  The images show a community last assembled at graduation during America’s most
  prosperous moment, regrouping in 2009-2010 during the toughest economic and
  social circumstances since the Great Depression. These portraits examine what
  had been gained or lost in the interim.


  Some are recovering from job losses, drug and alcohol addiction and loss of
  family. Others are building families, achieving in their early careers and
  volunteering in their communities. They are gay and straight, veteran and
  adult entertainer, married and divorced. Like all generations, we struggle to
  define ourselves as parents, citizens, family members and spouses. We work to
  create meaningful lives; we work to understand what “meaningful” looks like.
