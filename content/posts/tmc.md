blog_content: >-
  Come hang this Thursday at our new studio. I'll be curating playlists for The
  Mckinley Club and discussing the influence of music in my work.⁠


  ⁠“Our playlists help motivate, inspire, unwind, and uplift our members. We
  understand how important music is to our workflow. We’ve partnered with
  photographer Jesse Rieser who has created a playlist for TMC. Join us on Jan
  25th for a night of drinks, food, hangs, and a conversation with Jesse about
  the influence of music in his work.”⁠
