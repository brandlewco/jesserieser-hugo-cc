  I recently had the pleasure of sitting down with Alex Gagne for *The Photo
  Banter*. We cover a range of topics from my past to current works, my
  photographic philosophies, and navigating both the art and the commissioned
  audience of the industry. We also touch on something I have been thinking a
  lot about lately- time as a medium... Conceptually, technically, and
  thematically. ⁠⁠


  It was such an honor to join an impressive list of peers, mentors, and
  photographic legends.

  > *On today’s podcast I speak with photographer Jesse Rieser. Jesse Has worked
  with clients such as ESPN, Coca Cola, Esquire, The NBA, and Adidas to name a
  few. In this interview I speak to Jesse about his recent cover shoot with NBA
  player Devin Booker for ESPN , I also speak to Jesse about his approach to
  assignment work and how he balances the worlds of Art & Commerce. I’ve always
  enjoyed Jesse’s use of color in his photographs so I was excited to get a
  chance to speak with him about his recent project titled “Phoenix : A
  Dystopian Legoland that tastes Like Candy” which is a series of urban
  landscape photos and portraits that utilize color and space in a unique way.
  Jesse brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the photographic industry
  so I was pumped to get a chance to speak with him about his journey with
  photography so I hope you enjoy and thanks for listening.*
