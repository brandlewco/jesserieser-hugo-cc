blog_header: UnBound 13! Exhibition
caption: July 5th - August 3rd
blog_content: >-
  [*American Hypnosis*](https://jesserieser.com/collections/folklore/) is on
  display through August 3rd in the annual UnBound exhibition at [Candela
  Gallery.](https://www.candelagallery.com)


  Now in its 13th year, the UnBound Annual Exhibition is presented by the
  Candela Gallery and Photography Book publishing in Richmond, VA.


  By definition, hypnosis is the induction of a state of consciousness in which
  a person loses the power of voluntary action and is highly responsive to
  suggestion or direction.


  Having spent my formative years in the American “heartland,” I considered
  myself a patriot, and like many, I had a deep sense of pride for my country.
  But today, being an American feels similar to an animal pacing within the
  confines of a zoo. If provided the illusion of just enough freedom you can
  mask the reality of one’s own captivity. The result leaves me with a sense of
  waning dignity. We are collectively on display to intrigue, terrify, and
  satisfy the world's voyeuristic curiosity.


  Here, you will find surreal postcards from this fever dream—a feeling of
  familiar uneasiness transmitted from a citizen who is equally intrigued by his
  home as he is alarmed. They are deceptively nuanced photographs of—and for—an
  America that has done everything it can to abolish nuance, creating
  bleached-out stand-ins for the place itself. In a time in which the truth is
  constantly under attack, American Hypnosis proves these same truths can be
  stranger than fiction.
