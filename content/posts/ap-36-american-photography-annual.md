blog_content: >-
  I am honored to share that [***The Internet Giant Who Went
  Too***](https://jesserieser.com/collections/wired-magazine/) Far for *Wired*
  has been named one of the yearâ€™s best by the [***American Photography 36
  Annual***](https://www.ai-ap.com/slideshow/AP/36/?status=selected267) for
  editorial photography.


  Published in the July / August 2019 issue, I photographed Michael Lacey and
  Jim Larkin as they await trial for owning the online classified giant
  [Backpage.com](http://Backpage.com). Backpage was the red-light district of
  the internet or the Google of commercial sex ads, and for this both men face
  life in prison. As they await trial they are under country arrest and cannot
  travel.


  Photographically I wanted to portray Lacey and Larkin in a way that spoke to
  their decades of defiance, possible incarceration, the shadowy space in which
  Backpage operated, and their physical and psychological imprisonment as they
  are confined to their homes and Maricopa County. In hindsight, these works
  take on new meaning as we have been participating in our own levels of
  compliance and
  isolation.<br>[**Article**](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-backpage-vicious-battle-feds/)
