caption: A Visual Conversation with Matt Magee & Jesse Rieser
content: >-
  In collaboration with Red Modern, The Sunset Spot is a new exhibition program
  curated by artist, Jesse Willenbring, inside Jonathan Wayne’s eponymous store.
  Each exhibition is a pairing of artworks by two artists displayed alongside
  two pieces of corresponding furniture. One combination is displayed inside a
  sparse gallery and another is displayed within the context of the store.


  I am exhibiting with celebrated modern artist [**Matt Magee**](). In response
  Magee's *Poem for Dublin*, *Green 7*, and *Flag Hanger*, I am previewing works
  from the upcoming *A Vanishing American Folklore* and *Stalking A Serial
  Killer* book. The exhibition is structured for collectors to view the work
  with socially distanced appointments and a complimentary face covering
  designed by by [**Jesse
  Willenbring**](https://www.ceyssonbenetiere.com/en/artists/Jesse-Willenbring/).


  Curator Jesse Willenbring-­<br>*"For the past decade, my wife and I have
  worked collaboratively under the name, The Sunset People. We have a shared
  list of passing thoughts about sunsets and their relationship to our work as
  visual communicators. We often return to this list as a place of inspiration
  at the start of a project. Our modest, slightly clunky notes remind us of a
  philosophical ideal larger than the work we pursue. One of my favorites is,
  “take a deep breath and make time to take in the sunset at the end of each
  day.”*


  *For this project I wanted to create a place to reflect upon our collective
  relationship to an earth that gives back a unique sublime beauty daily. The
  sun’s bright hot life is also the world’s most efficient demarcation of time
  passed. Ever prescient right now, it feels like a safe reminder that we are
  not alone during this lonely time. Experiencing a good sunset is like the best
  of an art exhibition, simultaneously universal and yet personal in meaning.*


  *In collaboration with Red Modern Furniture, The Sunset Spot is a new
  exhibition program inside Jonathan Wayne’s eponymous store. It is a westward
  facing wall within a retail space that presents a pairing of artworks by two
  artists. Select pieces of furniture will encourage and enhance what is in
  front you. Matt Magee, Jesse Rieser is the inaugural exhibition.*


  *Matt Magee and Jesse Rieser are wanderers. They’re masters of the passing
  observation: bringing light to the splendor of everyday visual happenstance.
  To Matt Magee a discarded aluminum can, a tube of green paint, a misprinted
  fortune cookie text, or a shadow glanced from an open studio door equally
  contribute to his visual lexicon. For Jesse Rieser, “his use of light and
  bleached color, leaves the viewer with the illusion that our existence is
  equally beautiful as it is fleeting.” Together, these two artists present
  works that reveal and look back at us, putting the viewer on the spot while
  giving us a starting point to create our own languages and stories.*


  *The pandemic has shocked us all and although it has restricted our return to
  ‘normal’ it has not limited the potential to use art to create distinct,
  memorable experiences. The sun will set again tomorrow, enjoy another one
  today."*

  been dealing art and rare mid-century furniture for nearly three decades. “A
  piece of art, a well-designed chair, both carry stories and history that
  transform banality into magic – blank walls into conversations with friends
  and ancestors.”

  Pratt and mentored by Robert Rauschenberg. Known for his minimal abstract
  paintings and sculptures widely collected and exhibited.


  Jesse Rieser exhibiting artist (***bottom right***) Rieser’s photographic work
  focusses on the unique American experience. His use of light and bleached
  color, leaves the viewer with the illusion that our existence is equally
  beautiful as it is fleeting. He and his projects have been featured in the NY
